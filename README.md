DEMI is a novel package written in R that is designed to performe differential expression analysis on high-density (Affymetrix) microarrays. The performance of the algorithm has been published in [Nucleic Acid Research, 2014](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/8/e72.full). More information about our algorithm can also be found in [here](http://biit.cs.ut.ee/demi).
